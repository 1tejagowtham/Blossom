AS PART OF CODECADEMY PROJECT:-

The language of the flowers has a long history and has often been a topic resigned to the domain of dusty books in a thrift bookseller or a library. With Blossom, I want to give people lightning fast access to all of the possible meanings of their favorite flowers.

In this project, I am going to IMPLEMENT A HASH MAP to relate the names of flowers to their meanings. In order tO AVOID COLLISIONS WHEN OUR HASHING FUNCTION COLLIDES the names of two flowers, we are GOING TO USE SEPARATE CHAINING. Implemented the Linked List data structure for each of these separate chains.


script.py is the main file and blossom_lib.py and linked_list.py are the supporting files for the script to execute 

linked_list.py containes Node and LinkedList classes which are used for seperate chaining in HashMap

blossom_lib.py is a list of different such ['flower', 'definitions'] lists
